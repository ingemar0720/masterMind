masterMind is a code-breaking game for two players. <br /> 
The game is played using:<br /> 
    1) a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) <br /> 
    additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes.<br /> 
    2) code pegs of six (or more; see Variations below) different colors, with round heads, which will be placed in the large <br /> 
    holes on the board.<br /> 
    3) key pegs, some colored black, some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the<br />  
    small holes on the board.<br /> 
    4) The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number. One player becomes the <br /> 
    codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. Duplicates and blanks are allowed <br /> 
    depending on player choice, so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color or four blanks. <br /> 
    5) The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve (or ten, or eight) turns. Each guess is <br /> 
    made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to <br /> 
    four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess <br /> 
    which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the<br />  
    wrong position.<br /> 
    6) If there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same number <br /> of
    duplicate colours in the hidden code.<br />
