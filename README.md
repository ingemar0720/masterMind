masterMind is a code-breaking game for two players. 
The game is played using:
    1) a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) 
    additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes.
    2) code pegs of six (or more; see Variations below) different colors, with round heads, which will be placed in the large 
    holes on the board.
    3) key pegs, some colored black, some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the 
    small holes on the board.
    4) The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number. One player becomes the 
    codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. Duplicates and blanks are allowed 
    depending on player choice, so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color or four blanks. 
    5) The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve (or ten, or eight) turns. Each guess is 
    made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to 
    four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess 
    which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the 
    wrong position.
    6) If there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same number of
    duplicate colours in the hidden code.
